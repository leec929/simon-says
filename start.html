                    <h2>What is Simon Says?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Traditionally, Simon Says is a game where the players follow a given rule when "Simon" gives it.
                        <br>
                        In this version, Simon Says is a memory game played with 3x3 tiles.
                        Test your memory and see how far you can make it!

                    <h2>Game Play</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are 9 tiles, laid out in a 3x3 fashion. At the beginning of each level, a random tile blinks.
                        <br>The player must remember the blinking sequence from the first level, and then press the tiles in the correct sequence.
                        <br>For example, if a green tile blinked in the first level and a blue tile blinked in the second level, the player (to pass level 2) should tap the green tile followed by the blue tile.
